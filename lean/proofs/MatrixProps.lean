  Theorem: If a matrix is `nonNegative`,
  then `matrixSum(M)` is ≥ 0.

In a fully formal version, you'd systematically map the
"h : nonNegative M" property to each element of 'head' and 'tail'
via index reasoning. The skeleton is here; you can refine
the "sorry" part with an actual index-based argument.
